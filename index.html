            Hello! My name is Gabriel Breeding. I am currently a student and Ranken Technical College <br>
            in the App and Web development program. I enjoy programming and want to be a developer in <br>
            the future, so I am excited to be going to college.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I get home I care for my pet rabbit, and start on doing my online classwork. I have <br>
            dinner on weekdays at 5 and as a hobby I'll play videogames.
